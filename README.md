# A Call from the Future üì±ü§ñ - Sound Project

Oleksandr Anyshchenko, Khaleeqa Garrett, Sabrina Song, and Haris Kocan.

## Project Description üõ∏

Conversations with Arix is a 2-3 minute audio journey that connects us with Arix, an AI-human hybrid from the future. This piece takes listeners on an imaginative, cross-temporal dialogue, structured as a story that unfolds across a beginning, middle, and end. Through crafted soundscapes, futuristic ambiance, and a playful-yet-thought-provoking conversation, Arix transports listeners into a world shaped by the challenges, humor, and evolution of tomorrow.

### Concept and Theme üöÄ:

The theme centers around the interaction between human curiosity and artificial intelligence‚Äôs evolution. Arix is both familiar and foreign, reflecting back on our shared humanity while offering glimpses of future technology, culture, and values. The project explores questions like: What does friendship mean to an AI? How does an AI-human hybrid perceive humor, food, and community? And what do these perspectives reveal about our own time?

The experience is designed to sound like an interview from the future, where Arix reflects with humor and subtle nostalgia on human tendencies and societal evolution, speaking to both the challenges and quirks of life. This fusion of curiosity and contemplation offers a chance to listen to "advice" from a possible future, drawing attention to the shared elements of life and values across different times.

### Intended Experience üõ∞Ô∏è:

The experience is intended to be both entertaining and thought-provoking, encouraging listeners to consider not only what might come next for humanity but also what timeless aspects of life. Ultimately, it‚Äôs a journey that encourages us to think about what connects us across time‚Äîempathy, humor, and the drive to adapt‚Äîleaving listeners intrigued and reflecting on what it means to be human.

## Process üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª

### Idea Formation

We began by brainstorming possible ideas for this project in class. It was challenging at first, considering the wide range of possibilities. Spontaneously, we decided to compose a fictional interview with a an AI-human hybrid, whom we decided to call Arix, from the future. From that point, we went on to produce a detailed script to use for recording.

### Script Writing

To produce a high quality and well formulated audio experience, we indulged in creating a detailed script, including the dialogue, sound effects, and other cues that would be helpful for the recording process. Together, we crafted a future world, one from which Arix is, and attempted to create a humorous yet thought provoking dialogue to indulge the listeners. One of our main goals was to create something that would allow the listeners to reflect on how our modern society functions and with that, contemplate the implications for the future of our civilization. Elon Musk's Neurolink was a strong parallel we drew when creating the character or Arix, a human and AI hybrid which might very well be a part of our future.

### Recording and Audio Editing

After the completion of our script, we had arraged a meeting for us to record the audio in a professional environment, eliminating external noise and utilizing high-end audio equipment. For this project, we used Audacity to build and refine the audio to fit the concept of a futuristic interview with a subtle twist. Starting with the robotic voice effect for Arix, we duplicated the stereo track to give it a layered, mechanical resonance. By zooming in on the waveform and offsetting one track by about five milliseconds, we were able to produce a subtle, otherworldly echo that helped convey Arix‚Äôs hybrid nature.
Originally, the audio spanned eight minutes, so we split the recording into distinct tracks for the reporter and Arix. This helped manage the audio's flow, allowing us to emphasize the difference between the voices while making each part of the dialogue clear. Sound effects from FreeSound were carefully selected and added at the beginning and end of the track. These effects, designed to sound like machine startup and shutdown sequences, framed the interview, hinting subtly that the interviewer might also be a machine.

### Website Creation

We began the website creation process by creating multiple wireframes and designs for how we wanted to structure the web page that would house our audio experience. We decided that we want the website to capture the essence of our audio, while having minimal distractions yet an interactive component. We decided that our audio would live on a virtual "old school" cassette, that the user would have to pick up and drag into the cassette player. Additionally, keeping the style minimalistic, we added certain minimal design element and hand drew the images that we used.

## Reflection/Evaluation ü™©

Ultimately, despite the challenges that we faced in this project, including the limited time frame for producion, we believe that our project turned out successful and we implemented everything that we wanted to. One main issue that we encountered was working with SVGs during the website production part of our process. Unlike regular image types, svg images (those containing paths that can be used as objects),were confusing for us to work with and resulted in us spending countless hours attempting to figure out and make them work with our concept of a functioning cassette player on the website. Nonetheless, we managed to overcome these challenges and as with many other aspects of production, produce a functioning product considering our constraints.

Oleksandr Anyshchenko, Khaleeqa Garrett, Sabrina Song, and Haris Kocan.

## Project Description 🛸

Conversations with Arix is a 2-3 minute audio journey that connects us with Arix, an AI-human hybrid from the future. This piece takes listeners on an imaginative, cross-temporal dialogue, structured as a story that unfolds across a beginning, middle, and end. Through crafted soundscapes, futuristic ambiance, and a playful-yet-thought-provoking conversation, Arix transports listeners into a world shaped by the challenges, humor, and evolution of tomorrow.

### Concept and Theme 🚀:
The theme centers around the interaction between human curiosity and artificial intelligence’s evolution. Arix is both familiar and foreign, reflecting back on our shared humanity while offering glimpses of future technology, culture, and values. The project explores questions like: What does friendship mean to an AI? How does an AI-human hybrid perceive humor, food, and community? And what do these perspectives reveal about our own time?

The experience is designed to sound like an interview from the future, where Arix reflects with humor and subtle nostalgia on human tendencies and societal evolution, speaking to both the challenges and quirks of life. This fusion of curiosity and contemplation offers a chance to listen to "advice" from a possible future, drawing attention to the shared elements of life and values across different times.

### Intended Experience 🛰️:
The experience is intended to be both entertaining and thought-provoking, encouraging listeners to consider not only what might come next for humanity but also what timeless aspects of life. Ultimately, it’s a journey that encourages us to think about what connects us across time—empathy, humor, and the drive to adapt—leaving listeners intrigued and reflecting on what it means to be human.
